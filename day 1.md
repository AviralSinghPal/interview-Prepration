# Interview Preparation Questions

Welcome to this collection of interview preparation questions! Below, you'll find a list of key concepts and questions to help you review and reinforce your understanding. These questions cover various aspects of React, JavaScript, and related topics.

Feel free to use this README as a quick reference guide for your interview preparations.

## Questions

1. **What is a Pure Component?**
   A pure component in React returns the same output for the same input props and state.

2. **Define First-Class Functions:**
   First-class functions can be treated like variables, passed as arguments, or returned from other functions.

3. **Explain Conditional Rendering in React:**
   Conditional rendering involves rendering different components based on a condition, like `{condition ? component1 : component2}`.

4. **What is Throttling, and How Often Does It Execute a Function?**
   Throttling limits how often a function can be executed, e.g., every 2 seconds.

5. **Purpose of Debouncing in JavaScript:**
   Debouncing executes a function after a pause of inactivity, e.g., after 2 seconds of no activity.

6. **List Optimization Techniques in React:**
   Optimization techniques include lazy loading, `useMemo`, and `useCallback`.

7. **Static Typing vs Dynamic Typing:**
   Static typing requires type declarations before runtime (e.g., TypeScript), while dynamic typing infers types at runtime (e.g., JavaScript).

8. **Trigger Re-Render on Browser Window Resize:**
   Use `addEventListener("resize", (event) => {})` to re-render components when the browser window is resized.

9. **Recall React Component Lifecycle Methods:**
   Review the lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and more.

10. **What to Review About Redux:**
    Brush up on the fundamentals of Redux, a state management library for React.

11. **Usage of `useContext` in React:**
    Summarize the usage of the `useContext` hook for accessing context data.

12. **Custom Hooks in React:**
    Explore the concept of custom hooks for reusing logic across components.

13. **Limitations of React:**
    Mention a couple of limitations such as a complex learning curve and abstraction challenges.

14. **Compare `useMemo` and `useCallback` Hooks:**
    Explain the differences between `useMemo` (memoizing values) and `useCallback` (memoizing functions).

15. **Roles of `useContext` and Redux in State Management:**
    Contrast the usage of `useContext` and Redux for state management in React.

## Usage

Feel free to review these questions at your own pace. You can use this README as a quick reference before interviews or technical discussions to refresh your memory and understanding.

Good luck with your interview preparations!
